# Questions

## Must we make Laravel Golang from scratch or adapt previous framework like Revel?

## Should we use web toolkits like [Isis](https://github.com/kataras/iris), [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/), [Martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini) etc.

## Should we simply translate Laravel code to Golang = is it possible? - or we must consider Laravel only a model?

## Why not begin with a template engine based on Blade? Or we must alter [Pongo2](https://github.com/flosch/pongo2) to our requirements?
