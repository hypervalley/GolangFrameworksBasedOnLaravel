- Must we make Laravel Golang from scratch or adapt previous MVC framework like [Revel](https://github.com/revel/revel), [Utron](https://github.com/gernest/utron), [Rigo](https://github.com/micln/higo) etc?

- Should we use http web frameworks or web toolkits like [Buffalo](http://gobuffalo.io/docs/getting-started), [Iris](https://github.com/kataras/iris), [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/), [Gorilla](https://github.com/gorilla), [Martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini) etc.

- How much of Laravel should be followed: service container, services providers, folder structure and various components (Controller, Request, Response etc)? They should be rewritten in Golang or it is acceptable and reasonable to use similar components written in Golang?

- What about choose Lumen instead of Laravel. It would be more easy and fast.

- Why not begin with a template engine based on Blade? For example, [Pongo2](https://github.com/flosch/pongo2) or [Plush](https://github.com/gobuffalo/plush) could be modified to suit Blade features, couldn't it? Or these projects are acceptable.
