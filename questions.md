- Must we make Laravel Golang from scratch or adapt previous MVC framework like [Revel](https://github.com/revel/revel), [Utron](https://github.com/gernest/utron), [Rigo](https://github.com/micln/higo) etc?

- Should we use http web frameworks or web toolkits like [Iris](https://github.com/kataras/iris), [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/), [Gorilla](https://github.com/gorilla), [Martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini) etc.

- How much of laravel should be followed: service container, services providers, folder structure and Various components (Controller, Request, Response etc)? They must be translated to Golang or is acceptable and reasonable use similar components write in Golang?

- Why not begin with a template engine based on Blade? For example, [Pongo2](https://github.com/flosch/pongo2) would be changed to our requirements?
